/**
 * An IndexedDB-backed instance of Persistence. Data is stored persistently
 * across sessions.
 *
 * Currently the Firestore SDK only supports a single consumer of the database,
 * but browsers obviously support multiple tabs. IndexedDbPersistence ensures a
 * single consumer of the database via an "owner lease" stored in the database.
 *
 * On startup, IndexedDbPersistence assigns itself a random "ownerId" and writes
 * it to a special "owner" object in the database (if no entry exists already or
 * the current entry is expired). This owner lease is then verified inside every
 * transaction to ensure the lease has not been lost.
 *
 * If a tab opts not to acquire the owner lease (because there's an existing
 * non-expired owner) or loses the owner lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a
 * failed state and all subsequent operations will automatically fail.
 *
 * The current owner regularly refreshes the owner lease with new timestamps to
 * prevent newly-opened tabs from taking over ownership.
 *
 * Additionally there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the owner
 * lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make sure that
 * a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the owner lease).
 * Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload since it is
 * an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the lease,
 * the owner writes its ownerId to a "zombiedOwnerId" entry in LocalStorage
 * which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and take the
 * owner lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.
