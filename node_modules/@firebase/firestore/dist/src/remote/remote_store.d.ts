 * RemoteStore - An interface to remotely stored data, basically providing a

 *
 * RemoteStore is responsible for maintaining the connection to the server.
 * - maintaining a list of active listens.
 * - reconnecting when the connection is dropped.
 * - resuming all the active listens on reconnect.
 *
 * RemoteStore handles all incoming events from the Datastore.
 * - listening to the watch stream and repackaging the events as RemoteEvents
 * - notifying SyncEngine of any changes to the active listens.
 *
 * RemoteStore takes writes from other components and handles them reliably.
 * - pulling pending mutations from LocalStore and sending them to Datastore.
 * - retrying mutations that failed because of network problems.
 * - acking mutations to the SyncEngine once they are accepted or rejected.
